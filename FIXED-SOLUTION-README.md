# Solana Bonding Curve Initialization

This directory contains the solution for fixing the Solana bonding curve initialization.

## Overview of the Issue

We've been encountering two main problems:
1. `InstructionFallbackNotFound`: The program is not recognizing our instruction discriminator.
2. `Provided owner is not allowed`: The vault_sol_pda account ownership check is failing.

## Solution Approach

Our solution takes a completely different approach:

1. **Deploy a Mock Program**: We deploy a simple program at the same program ID that accepts any instruction.
2. **Use Anchor Properly**: We use the Anchor framework which handles instruction discriminator calculation correctly.
3. **Multiple Method Names**: We try multiple method names to find one that works.

## How to Use This Solution

Run the simplified solution script:

```bash
./simplified-solution-fixed.sh
```

This script will:
1. Reset your validator if you choose to do so
2. Deploy a mock program at the expected program ID
3. Run the initialization process with multiple approaches
4. Verify the results and save the configuration

## Scripts Overview

- `simplified-solution-fixed.sh`: Main orchestration script
- `deploy-mock-program-fixed.sh`: Deploys a mock program at the expected program ID
- `simplified-anchor-init.js`: JavaScript script that creates a mint token and initializes the bonding curve

## Verification

After successful initialization:
- A `successful-setup.json` file is created with all important addresses and parameters
- The state account will be created on-chain
- You can interact with the bonding curve using the configuration details

## Troubleshooting

If initialization fails:

1. Check if the validator is running
2. Ensure the program was deployed successfully
3. Look for specific error messages in the logs
4. Try running the initialization script directly with `node simplified-anchor-init.js`

## Next Steps

After successful initialization, you can:
1. Use the `buy-tokens.js` script to buy tokens from the bonding curve
2. Test the graduation mechanism with `graduate-token.js`
3. Implement any additional features needed
