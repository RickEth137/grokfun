# Solana Bonding Curve Program Analysis & Test Results

## Program Overview
This project implements a linear bonding curve (similar to pump.fun) for token launches on Solana, supporting operations such as initializing a launch, buying and selling tokens, withdrawing fees, and graduating when certain thresholds are met.

## Key Components
- **Program ID:** CYUSvq2vmNZ4rcyhfKyfaTKvfeH3doxyqx69ifV3w3TP
- **Mint Address:** FF5Khx5KBpyZKurFM4zUe2L4C7FWzAAZ92sP7mEWqvCJ
- **Important PDAs:**
  - Authority PDA: 9uvWNL8wpXoLxd5tLDKpGEWuXgdxHqH6DURU1MQhHYh
  - State PDA: H4hucDh7erbZMAzwDwVRy1KnrUxzcEa67kb6LVzPs1wq
  - Vault SOL PDA: 4bH2pQmuG4Qnq8PwUQt4L5EkDZSdtUg7ashyWfRnt835
  - Vault ATA: HtgCcEQZYCo2BV7kgr2cdD9qe2DPmZDBHhVxjmcwiuDD

## Primary Issue Identified
We encountered a persistent "DeclaredProgramIdMismatch" error when interacting with the program. This indicates that the program ID hardcoded within the deployed program does not match the address where the program is deployed.

### Issue Details
- The program at address `CYUSvq2vmNZ4rcyhfKyfaTKvfeH3doxyqx69ifV3w3TP` was compiled with a different program ID
- The original source code used program ID `PQghCjXvt7v7YYDo4rsgWJzxEQhSJmFLGjM5DPikuJE`
- We also tried deploying to a new address `dgJXkP3PX6yU3vedRwXSARYRund9pDqz6hxXFBae2Q7`
- Anchor's validation strictly prevents interaction with a program if the program ID mismatch is detected

## Attempted Solutions
1. **Modified the `declare_id!` in lib.rs** - Updated the program ID in source code and redeployed
2. **Created raw instructions** - Attempted to bypass Anchor's validation with direct instructions
3. **Deployed new program** - Created a new program ID and deployed a fresh version
4. **Used original program ID** - Attempted to use the ID hardcoded in the original source

## Recommendations
Given the challenges with the program ID mismatch, here are our recommended approaches:

### 1. Use the Original Program ID
The most direct solution would be to deploy the program with the original ID that was used during compilation:
```
PQghCjXvt7v7YYDo4rsgWJzxEQhSJmFLGjM5DPikuJE
```

This requires:
1. Generating a keypair file that corresponds to this public key
2. Deploying the program with this specific keypair

### 2. Rebuild the Program
Alternatively, you can rebuild the program with the correct program ID:
1. Update `declare_id!()` in lib.rs to match your desired program ID
2. Ensure Anchor.toml has the same program ID
3. Clean and rebuild the project
4. Deploy the program with the matching keypair

### 3. Create a New Implementation
For immediate testing, you can:
1. Use our JavaScript simulation to test the bonding curve logic
2. Create a simplified Solana program implementing just the core functionality
3. Deploy it with a fresh program ID

## Bonding Curve Functionality
We've created a JavaScript simulation (`bonding-curve-simulation.js`) that demonstrates the core functionality:

1. **Buy Tokens:** Purchase tokens at a price determined by the bonding curve
2. **Sell Tokens:** Sell tokens back to the bonding curve
3. **Withdraw Fees:** Platform and creator can withdraw their fees
4. **Graduate:** When the target SOL amount is reached, the launch graduates

## Next Steps
To continue testing the full program functionality, select one of the following approaches:

1. **Obtain the Original Keypair:** Get the keypair for `PQghCjXvt7v7YYDo4rsgWJzxEQhSJmFLGjM5DPikuJE`
2. **Complete Rebuild:** Rebuild the program with consistent program IDs
3. **Client Simulation:** Use our JavaScript simulation for testing core functionality

## Conclusion
The program implements a well-designed bonding curve mechanism, but the deployment challenges with program ID mismatch prevented full on-chain testing. With the above recommendations, you should be able to resolve these issues and continue developing and testing the program.
