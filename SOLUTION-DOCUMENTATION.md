# Solana Bonding Curve Solution Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an explanation of the solution for initializing and operating a Solana bonding curve contract. The solution addresses two key issues:

1. **InstructionFallbackNotFound Error**: Fixed by identifying the correct discriminator format for instructions.
2. **Provided owner is not allowed Error**: Ensured proper ownership of the vault_sol_pda account.

## Files in the Solution

- **final-solution.js**: Main initialization script with the correct discriminator and account structure
- **test-bonding-operations.js**: Tests buying and selling tokens on the bonding curve
- **complete-bonding-solution.sh**: Full end-to-end setup, initialization and testing script
- **manual-test-operations.js**: Helper script for running manual operations

## Technical Approach

### 1. Discriminator Resolution

The key insight for solving the discriminator issue was identifying that the program uses Anchor's global namespace format for instruction discriminators. 

The correct format for the `initializeLaunch` instruction is:
```javascript
const discriminator = generateDiscriminator("global", "initialize_launch");
```

This generates the discriminator bytes: `[90, 201, 220, 142, 112, 253, 100, 13]`

For other instructions, we follow the same pattern:
- buy: `global:buy` → `[...]`
- sell: `global:sell` → `[...]`
- withdraw_fees: `global:withdraw_fees` → `[...]`

### 2. Vault Ownership Issue

The `vault_sol_pda` account must be owned by the System Program, not the token program. When initializing, the program creates this account but expects it to be uninitialized with the System Program as its owner.

The solution ensures:
1. Fresh validator state or new mint to avoid pre-existing PDAs
2. Proper validation of account ownership before attempting initialization
3. Correct account layouts following Solana conventions

### 3. State Account Parsing

We implemented proper state account parsing similar to the Pump.fun example, handling:
- Reading big integers in little-endian format
- Extracting state values from the correct offsets
- Price calculation based on the linear bonding curve formula

### 4. Transaction Structure

For successful transactions, the solution includes:
- Compute budget instructions to handle complex operations
- Skip preflight options for more reliable transactions
- Proper error handling and detailed logging

## Bonding Curve Parameters

The bonding curve is initialized with:
- Base price: 0.01 SOL (10,000,000 lamports)
- Slope: 0.0001 SOL/token (100,000 lamports/token)
- Fee: 0.5% (50 basis points)
- Creator Fee: 2.5% (250 basis points)
- Graduation Target: 10 SOL (10,000,000,000 lamports)

## Running the Solution

Execute the complete solution with:
```bash
./complete-bonding-solution.sh
```

This will:
1. Reset the validator and deploy the program
2. Initialize the bonding curve
3. Test buying and selling tokens
4. Create a manual operations helper script

## Debugging Tools

The solution includes debugging tools such as:
- Account state inspection
- Price and cost calculation functions
- Transaction log analysis
- Discriminator testing utilities
